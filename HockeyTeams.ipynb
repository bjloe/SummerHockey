    "# Summer Hockey\n",
    "\n",
    "My sister-in-law asked me to help her set up a summer hockey league\n",
    "that has twenty players who will play for thirteen weeks.  Every week\n",
    "the twenty players will be divided into two teams of ten. Since the\n",
    "players all play for the same club in the winter and they all have\n",
    "\\\"home\\\" and \\\"away\\\" jerseys, we'll assign the players to \\\"home\\\"\n",
    "and \\\"away\\\" teams. Players can be assigned to teams without regard to\n",
    "position. The goal is to make the assignments to minimize the number\n",
    "of weeks that any pair of players is assigned to the same (or\n",
    "opposing) teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "My first thought was to assign players systematically. Given that $2^4\n",
    "< 20 < 2^5$ we know that we need to have a least five games before we\n",
    "can guarantee that no pair of players is on the same team every\n",
    "week. However, in any five-week period, there will be at two (or more)\n",
    "pairs of players who play together (or opposite) for four weeks.,\n",
    "\n",
    "I abandoned a systematic approach in favor of random assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you generate two schedules randomly, you need a way to compare\n",
    "them; that is a metric. The value of the metric tells you whether and\n",
    "which one is better (in our case a lower value will be better). You\n",
    "can save the better one as your \\\"best candidate,\\\" generate a new\n",
    "schedule, and compare it to the current \\\"best candidate\\\". If the new\n",
    "one is better, promote it to \\\"best candidate,\\\" otherwise repeat the\n",
    "procedure.  Execute this process in a loop for a predetermined number\n",
    "of times.\n",
    "    \n",
    "When I say \\\"generate a new schedule\\\", there are at least two ways to\n",
    "do it. You could generate an entirely new schedule with each pass\n",
    "through the loop, or you could generate a new schedule based on a\n",
    "previous one. For example, replace one week in the best candidate\n",
    "schedule with the new week and see if that is an improvement. The new\n",
    "week in the schedule could be randomly generated or there may be a way\n",
    "to \\\"tweak\\\" the schedule to improve it.  Generating a completely new\n",
    "schedule is simpler to code, but the improving an existing schedule\n",
    "might be faster. However, tweaking an existing schedule carries the\n",
    "risk of leading to a local minimum.\n"

The quantity `np.sum((best_league + 1)//2,axis=0)` yields a 20 element vector with the j-th element representing the number of times player j is on the 'Home' team. We would like this vector to be close to 6.5 in each entry. One way to ensure this is to minimize standard deviation of the elements. If we can take a single week -- a row of the matrix `league` -- switching the 'Home' and 'Away' assignments only requires us to multiply by -1. If this decreases the standard deviation of the home assignments, then that would be a better league."
