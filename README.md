# SummerHockey
This is Jupyter notebook that generates a schedule for a summer hockey league consisting of 20 players. The 20 players 
are assigned to two teams of 10 each week for 13 weeks. Call the teams "Home" and "Away". 
Assignments are made without regard to player positions.  However, 
we want to make sure that no pair of players plays together (or in opposition) every week. Also, make sure that all
players are assigned to the "Home" or "Away" teams as evenly as possible.
